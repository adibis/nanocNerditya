I recently finished reading Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman. Ever since reading Neverwehere, he has been one of my favorite authors. His books can be classified into a rather strange category - fairy tales for adults. They don't have the violence or the nudity found in books classified 'for adults' but, the content is mature at times. Then why fairy tales? From what I feel, he takes you back to your childhood while not making it sound too cheesy. Things aren't over simplified and explained as they would be to a child. Yet the subject matter is often what is found in children's books. Anansi Boys is another such book.
